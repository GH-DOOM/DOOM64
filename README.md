## Requirements
- DOOM 64 <sub>(tested on Epic Games version)</sub>
- Firefox
- Python 3

Feel free to port to other browsers!

## How to Use
1. **Install requirements** with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Start DOOM 64** before running the program, or it won't detect the game window.

## How Does It Work?
The program will:
1. Take a screenshot of your game as quickly as possible.
2. Resize the image to 51x7 pixels (not 52, as the last week isnâ€™t always full).
3. Change the color of each pixel.
4. Repeat!

For best results, run DOOM 64 in 800x600 resolution in windowed mode.
